1.) 
One of the requirements said to create an object literal for share widget UI however when I did this, the display function wouldn't display the entire list/array, but only the last one in the list. 

I opted to implement the minimum requirement function rather than the object oriented requirement format. 

2.) Not sure if this is required, but when a name is added onto the list, it doesn't automatically sort, only when either sort buttons are clicked.
